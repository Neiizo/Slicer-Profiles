# Slicer-Profiles
First and foremost, I recommend everyone to talk a close look at [Ellis' print tuning guide]([https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Print-Tuning-Guide]). You can have the best profile on the planet, but if your printer isn't properly tuned, you won't get really far.

##Regarding my profiles:
There are 2 things I absolutely love around 3D Printing. 
 1. All the possibilites a 3D printer gives you
 2. How much time you can spend trying to make your print perfect

The issue with the first point, is you need imagination. You can print whatever someone else has done over the internet, or you can make your own stuff. But when you don't have the imagination at a given time, you can't make your **own** stuff. That's often the case for me, so I spend a lot of time trying to make my print even more perfect. I obviously have a lot of work to do, but that's where the fun is.

##With what printer do I use my profiles with ?

I currently own 2 printers. A voron V0.1 and an ender 3 pro. I run the "same" profile for both. I have tuned my ender 3 pro to make it go faster without any loss of quality. It is a direct drive with an orbiter 2.0, a phaetus dragonfly hotend, the same as in my V0.1, and finally an hero me gen 7 fan duct. But it's still a bed slinger, and because of this, I cannot run the same acceleration value for both printers. However, most of the rest are the same.
